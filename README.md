**Yes, there is a large leap other much nicer software than AimStar. However, we shall never stop our step.**

<h4 align="center">
  ⛔ USE AT YOUR OWN RISK ⛔
</h4>
## ⛔本软件不适合弱智群体使用⛔

**那么，很不幸的是，Yang先生，我要挂你**

### 这是什么？
![46256e095ece623b3dc26a423c89117c](https://github.com/CowNowK/AimStar/assets/65479796/dcff3a7c-9f41-4f50-b812-3364a4ca6850)
- 大概Yang先生在吃精神病药的时候也没有看说明书，才造成了这样的结果吧
- 另一方面也显现出了我们Yang先生的低能，想必是生活无法自理的巨婴，开个挂都要别人像喂饭一样教你吧
- 如果我已经把用户端更新机制做得如此傻瓜化，仍然受到这样的攻击
- 那我的选择是放弃中国用户，让你们享受GFW，我带着洋大人爽快github下载就好了

### WOW 麻省理工学院毕业工程师

- 首先，我没有做过MIT的学生，哪怕是一秒钟，我连MIT的mooc都没看过
- 其次，我想也许这个世界上存在认为使用MIT licence就是MIT毕业生的弱智
- 最后，除了正在备考低压电工证之外，作为一个文科生，我找不到我和工程师有什么搭边的

### 笑死我了
- 其实我觉得免费给你开挂，你不会用还要乱叫，说别人是一坨狗屎结果看个英语还要靠翻译的人更好笑
- 请问全世界每天使用AimStar的那两千位用户，你们觉得他好笑吗？

## ⚠️ Disclamers
- 🚫 **The project is for learning purposes only and strictly prohibited for any illegal activities. Users bear full responsibility for any misuse.**
Please read the following advice carefully before using Aimstar.
<details> <summary>Some advice</summary>

- Aimstar is a hobby project, and it should be treated as such. The project aims to enhance the community's learning of process debugging and reverse engineering, and to demonstrate the potential of C++ programming on Windows systems. At the same time, we strongly oppose cheating in video games. If you use Aimstar to cheat, you will not only ruin the fairness and fun of the game, but also damage your own reputation and dignity.

- Cheating in video games may reflect your inner anxiety and dissatisfaction. You may feel that you are not good enough in the game, or that you are ridiculed and rejected by other players. You may hope to improve your game level and social status by cheating, or to bring yourself some happiness and sense of achievement. However, these are superficial and temporary, and cannot really solve your problem.

- Cheating will make you lose the challenge and fun of the game, as well as the respect and trust of other players. Cheating will make you fall into a false self-perception, and make you ignore your true strengths and potential. Cheating will make you miss the opportunity and process of improving yourself through hard work and learning.

- If you want to get rid of the temptation and consequences of cheating, you need to face your psychological state and motivation, and seek professional help and support. Communicating with a psychologist or counselor can help you find more healthy and effective coping strategies, and also help you build a more positive and confident self-image. You can also participate in some beneficial activities and social interactions, such as joining some game communities or clubs, making some like-minded friends, or trying some new games or interests.

- I hope you can recognize the harm and meaninglessness of cheating, and also hope you can enjoy the true fun and value of the game. I appreciate your interest and support for Aimstar, but I also hope you can abide by the rules and ethics of the game, and respect yourself and others. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation. 🙏

## ✈️ User group analysis
The data comes from monitoring the otp generator web page on cloudflare.
<details>

Nearly two thousand people use otp generation every day. Most of them are Internet cafe users, and many of them are new users. Combined with regional analysis, we can conclude that aimstar has hundreds of new users every day.

Users mainly come from China, Turkey, the Russian Federation, the United States and Southeast Asia, with Chinese users and Turkish users accounting for the majority.

In March to April 2024, we detected abnormal traffic in Germany, Japan, and the United States. Does this mean that aimstar has potential competitors in these countries? (imaging over 80k japs using AimStar in 12hrs xd)
